## Running locally

The instructions below assume that Git and Miniconda have already been installed locally. On Mac 
OS or Linux you can run the `which` command to check whether Git and Miniconda are installed.

```bash
$ which git
/usr/bin/git
$ which conda
/Users/$USERNAME/miniconda3/bin/conda
```

If both Git and Miniconda are properly installed, then the `which` command should return the 
absolute path to their respective executables.

### Cloning the Git repository

First you will either need to clone the entire repository and checkout the `binder` branch.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-gapminder.git
$ cd python-novice-gapminder/
$ git checkout -b binder
```

Alternatively, you can clone only the `binder` branch.

```bash
$ git clone -b binder --single-branch https://github.com/swcarpentry/python-novice-gapminder.git
$ cd python-novice-gapminder/
```

### Creating the Conda environment

After cloning the repo you can use the following command to build the environment on your local machine.

```bash
$ conda env create --prefix ./env --file environment.yml 
```

### Running JupyterLab

Once the environment has been created, then you can activate it and lauch the JupyterLab server.

```bash
$ conda activate ./env
$ jupyter lab
```
